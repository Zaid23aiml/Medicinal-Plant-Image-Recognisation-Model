# Medicinal-Plant-Image-Recognisation-Model
Plant Image Recognition System is a machine learning project that classifies plants based on images. It uses a pre-trained CNN model to predict the plant name, scientific name, and its medicinal benefits. The system is trained on 150 plant images and can be further expanded for better accuracy.
