# Medicinal-Plant-Image-Recognisation-Model
Plant Image Recognition System is a machine learning project that classifies plants based on images. It uses a pre-trained CNN model to predict the plant name, scientific name, and its medicinal benefits. The system is trained on 150 plant images and can be further expanded for better accuracy.
Key Features:
Image Classification: Recognizes plant species based on the uploaded image.

Plant Information: Displays the scientific name and medicinal benefits of identified plants.

Simple Interface: Users can upload images for fast plant identification.

Custom Dataset: The model is trained on a dataset of 150 plants, each represented by a single image.

Scalable: Designed for future improvements, including multi-image support per plant and expansion to more plant species.

Technologies Used:
Python

TensorFlow (Keras)

scikit-learn (KNN Classifier)

OpenCV

pandas (Data handling)

This project is ideal for plant enthusiasts, researchers, and developers interested in applying machine learning to plant identification. Future improvements will include more images per plant, better accuracy, and the addition of new plant species.
