# Plant Image Recognition System üåø

Welcome to the Plant Image Recognition System, a machine learning project that uses MobileNetV2 with TensorFlow and Keras to recognize plant species based on their images. This tool helps identify the plant name, scientific name, and medicinal benefits of a plant through a single uploaded image


## Introduction
This project is built to classify 150 unique plant species. Each plant in the dataset is represented by a single image, and the model predicts the plant‚Äôs identity and its medicinal uses. It serves as a valuable aid for plant enthusiasts, students, and researchers.
## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
Install required dependencies:

## Installation

Install required dependencies:

```bash
  pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib pandas
```
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Plant-Image-Recognition-System.git  
cd Plant-Image-Recognition-System 
```
    
## Model
We use MobileNetV2, a lightweight deep learning architecture ideal for image classification tasks, especially where limited data is available.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python

- TensorFlow & Keras

- OpenCV

- Pandas

- Matplotlib

- Google Colab
## Inference
Run the prediction:
```
python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg 
```
## Future Scope
This project can be improved by adding more images per plant, text-based search, real-time camera input, and expanding the database.
